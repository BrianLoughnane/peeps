Follow all users in a github organization from the command line.

Note: You'll need a github account with two-factor auth disabled, membership to the organization whose peeps you'd like to follow, python, and potentially a few other things I haven't realized yet.

Work in progress! Please feel free to make a pull request and suggest updates : )
